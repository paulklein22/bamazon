# Bamazon

## Bamazon is a Node.js app that allows the user to purchase items from a store. The app tracks the store's inventory and updates the product's stock quantity in the connected SQL database after a purchase is made.

### The user uses the arrow keys (or enters the item's ID) to choose an item and quantity to purchase. The purchase's total price is calculated.

### The stock quantity is decreased following a sale. This is also reflected in the SQL database.

### If the user attempts to purchase an item with insufficient stock, they will be alerted and the purchase will not complete.
