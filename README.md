# Bamazon

## Bamazon is a Node.js app that allows the user to purchase items from a store. The app tracks the store's inventory, updating the product's stock quantity in the connected SQL database after a purchase is made.

### The user uses the arrow keys (or enters the item's ID) to choose an item and quantity to purchase. The purchase's total price is calculated.

### The stock quantity is decreased following a sale. This is also reflected in the SQL database.
